Telepathy-testlib is a static library for building unit tests of KDE/Telepathy components.

It allows complicated unit tests which make use of a Private DBus Session Bus and a virtuoso
sandbox to avoid making a mess of the virtuoso/telepathy/dbus installations running on the
system where the tests are run.

This code is based on the unit tests code for telepathy-qt4, which can be found here:

      <p>In many real-time communication services the user can pay for certain
        services, typically calls to the
        <abbr title="Public Switched Telephone Network">PSTN</abbr>,
        in advance. In (at least) Skype, it's possible to query the current
        balance in a machine-readable way.</p>

      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>An amount of money in a specified currency. For example,
          3.21 British pounds would conventionally be represented by
          (<var>Amount</var> = <tt>321</tt>, <var>Scale</var> = <tt>2</tt>,
          <var>Currency</var> = <tt>"GBP"</tt>), but could be represented by
          (<var>Amount</var> = <tt>3210</tt>, <var>Scale</var> = <tt>3</tt>,
          <var>Currency</var> = <tt>"GBP"</tt>) in a service that records
          balance in units of 0.001 pounds.</p>

          32-bit unsigned integer) and <var>Currency</var> = <tt>""</tt>, this

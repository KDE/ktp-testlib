      <p>An interface for multi-user conference channels that can have
        additional individual channels merged into them after they are
        created.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>This interface addresses part of freedesktop.org <a
            href="http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24906">bug
            #24906</a> (GSM-compatible conference calls). GSM is currently
          the only protocol known to implement this; PBXs might implement
          it too.</p>

        <p>It might be made into a mandatory-to-implement part of Conference,
          or kept as a separate interface, when stabilized.</p>

        <p>Request that the given channel be incorporated into this

        <p>The given channel SHOULD be added to <tp:dbus-ref

            >Conference.DRAFT.Channels</tp:dbus-ref> if and only if the

          <p>In GSM it is possible to merge additional calls into an ongoing
            conference.</p>

          <p>In XMPP this method could be implemented to merge a 1-1 Text
            channel into a MUC Text channel by inviting the peer from the Text
            channel into the MUC, or to merge a 1-1 Jingle call into a Muji
            call by inviting the peer from the Jingle call into the Muji call.
            (MUC and Muji channels are both implemented by XMPP MUCs, with
            Handle_Type_Room.)</p>

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>A channel type for sending and receiving messages in plain text,
        with no formatting. In future specifications, channels for sending
        and receiving messages that can be reduced to plain text (i.e.
        formatted text) should also have this type.</p>

      <p>When a message is received, an identifier is assigned and a
        <tp:member-ref>Received</tp:member-ref> signal emitted, and the message
        placed in a pending queue which can be inspected with
        <tp:member-ref>ListPendingMessages</tp:member-ref>. A client which has
        handled the message by showing it to the user (or equivalent) should
        acknowledge the receipt using the
        <tp:member-ref>AcknowledgePendingMessages</tp:member-ref> method,
        and the message will then be removed from the pending queue. Numeric
        identifiers for received messages may be reused over the lifetime of
        the channel.</p>

      <p>Each message has an associated 'type' value, which should be one
        of the values allowed by
        <tp:type>Channel_Text_Message_Type</tp:type>.</p>

      <p>Each message also has a flags value, which is a bitwise OR of the
        flags given in <tp:type>Channel_Text_Message_Flags</tp:type>.</p>

      <p>Sending messages can be requested using the
        <tp:member-ref>Send</tp:member-ref> method, which will return
        successfully and emit the <tp:member-ref>Sent</tp:member-ref> signal
        when the message has been delivered to the server, or return an error
        with no signal emission if there is a failure. If a message is sent but
        delivery of the message later fails, this is indicated with the
        <tp:member-ref>SendError</tp:member-ref> signal.</p>

      <p>On protocols where additional contacts cannot be invited into
        a one-to-one chat, or where a one-to-one chat is just a series of
        individual personal messages rather than being represented by some
        object on the server (i.e. most protocols), one-to-one chats should be
        represented by a Text channel with <tp:type>Handle_Type</tp:type>
        CONTACT.</p>

      <p>Named chat rooms whose identity can be saved and used again later
        (IRC channels, Jabber MUCs) are expected to be represented by Text
        channels with <tp:type>Handle_Type</tp:type> ROOM and the <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Interface">Group</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface; they should usually also have the Properties interface.</p>

      <p>Unnamed, transient chat rooms defined only by their members (e.g. on
        MSN) are expected to be represented by Text channels with handle type
        0, handle 0, the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Interface">Group</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface, and optionally the Properties interface.</p>

      <p>On protocols where a conversation with a user is actually just
        a nameless chat room starting with exactly two members, to which
        more members can be invited, calling
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection">RequestChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
        with type Text
        and handle type CONTACT should continue to succeed, but may return
        a channel with handle type 0, handle 0, the group interface,
        and the local and remote contacts in its members.</p>

      <p>If a channel of type Text is closed while it has pending messages,
        the connection manager MUST allow this, but SHOULD open a new,
        identical channel to deliver those messages, signalling it as a new
        channel with the
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection">NewChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
        signal (with the suppress_handler parameter set to FALSE).</p>

      <p>If messages were sent on the old channel but the
        <tp:member-ref>Sent</tp:member-ref>signal has not yet been emitted
        for those messages, the new channel SHOULD emit Sent for those
        messages when appropriate - it behaves like a continuation of the
        old channel.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>In effect, this turns this situation, in which a client
          is likely to lose messages:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>UI window is closed</li>
          <li>message arrives</li>
          <li>text channel emits Received</li>
          <li>UI calls Close on text channel before it has seen the
            Received signal</li>
          <li>text channel emits Closed and closes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>into something nearly equivalent to this situation, which is
          fine:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>UI window is closed</li>
          <li>UI calls Close on text channel</li>
          <li>text channel emits Closed and closes</li>
          <li>message arrives</li>
          <li>new text channel is created, connection emits NewChannel</li>
          <li>(the same or a different) UI handles it</li>
        </ul>

        <p>suppress_handler must be set to FALSE so the replacement channel
          will be handled by something.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>As a result, Text channels SHOULD implement <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Channel.Interface.Destroyable</tp:dbus-ref>.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>This "respawning" behaviour becomes problematic if there is no
          suitable handler for Text channels, or if a particular message
          repeatedly crashes the Text channel handler; a channel dispatcher
          can't just Close() the channel in these situations, because
          it will come back.</p>

        <p>In these situations, the channel dispatcher needs a last-resort
          way to destroy the channel and stop it respawning. It could either
          acknowledge the messages itself, or use the Destroyable interface;
          the Destroyable interface has the advantage that it's not
          channel-type-dependent, so the channel dispatcher only has to
          understand one extra interface, however many channel types
          eventually need a distinction between Close and Destroy.</p>

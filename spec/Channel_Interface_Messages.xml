    <tp:added version="0.17.16">(as stable API)</tp:added>

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>This interface extends the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace='org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type'>Text</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface to support more general messages, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>messages with attachments (like MIME multipart/mixed)</li>
        <li>groups of alternatives (like MIME multipart/alternative)</li>
        <li>delivery reports (which replace <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">Text.SendError</tp:dbus-ref>),
          addding support for protocols where the message content is not echoed
          back to the sender on failure and for receiving positive
          acknowledgements, as well as ensuring that incoming delivery reports
          are not lost if no client is handling the channel yet;</li>
        <li>any extra types of message we need in future</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Incoming messages, outgoing messages, and delivery reports are all
        represented as lists of <tp:type>Message_Part</tp:type> structures,
        with a format reminiscent of e-mail. Messages are sent by calling
        <tp:member-ref>SendMessage</tp:member-ref>; outgoing messages are
        announced to other clients which may be interested in the channel by
        the <tp:member-ref>MessageSent</tp:member-ref> signal. Incoming
        messages and delivery reports are signalled by
        <tp:member-ref>MessageReceived</tp:member-ref>, and are stored in the
        the <tp:member-ref>PendingMessages</tp:member-ref> property until
        acknowledged by calling <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">Text.AcknowledgePendingMessages</tp:dbus-ref>.
        Only the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Handler</tp:dbus-ref>
        for a channel should acknowledge messages; <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Observer</tp:dbus-ref>s
        (such as loggers) and <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Approver</tp:dbus-ref>s
        for the channel may listen for incoming messages, and send messages of their own, but SHOULD NOT acknowledge messages.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>If observers were allowed to acknowledge messages, then messages
          might have been acknowledged before the handler even got to see the
          channel, and hence could not be shown to the user.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>If this interface is present, clients that support it SHOULD
        listen for the <tp:member-ref>MessageSent</tp:member-ref> and
        <tp:member-ref>MessageReceived</tp:member-ref> signals, and
        ignore the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Text">Sent</tp:dbus-ref>,
        <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Text">SendError</tp:dbus-ref>
        and <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Text">Received</tp:dbus-ref>
        signals on the Text interface (which are guaranteed to duplicate
        signals from this interface).</p>

      <p>Although this specification supports formatted (rich-text)
        messages with unformatted alternatives, implementations SHOULD NOT
        attempt to send formatted messages until the Telepathy specification
        has also been extended to cover capability discovery for message
        formatting.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        We intend to expose all rich-text messages as XHTML-IM, but on some
        protocols, formatting is an extremely limited subset of that format
        (e.g. there are protocols where foreground/background colours, font
        and size can be set, but only for entire messages).
        Until we can tell UIs what controls to offer to the user, it's
        unfriendly to offer the user controls that may have no effect.

          This list MUST NOT be empty, since all Messages implementations

        <p>Flags indicating the level of support for message parts on this
          channel. They are designed such that setting more flags always
          implies that the channel has more capabilities.</p>

        <p>If no flags are set, this indicates that messages may contain
          a single message part whose content-type is any of the types
          from SupportedContentTypes, possibly with some alternatives.</p>

        <p>There is no flag indicating support for alternatives. This is
          because the SendMessage implementation can always accept messages
          containing alternatives, even if the underlying protocol does not,
          by deleting all alternatives except the first (most preferred)
          that is supported.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          Each of the flags so far implies the previous flag, so we could
          have used a simple enumeration here; however, we've defined
          the message-part support indicator as a flag set for future
          expansion.

    <tp:mapping name="Message_Part" array-name="Message_Part_List"
      array-depth="2">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Part of a message's content. In practice, this mapping never
          appears in isolation: incoming messages are represented by a list of
          <tp:type>Message_Part</tp:type> mappings in the
          <tp:member-ref>MessageReceived</tp:member-ref> signal, and outgoing
          messages are passed to <tp:member-ref>SendMessage</tp:member-ref> as
          a list of these mappings.</p>

        <p>The first part of the message contains "headers", which refer
          to the entire message. The second and subsequent parts contain the
          message's content, including plain text, formatted text and/or
          attached files. Well-known keys for the header and body parts are
          defined by the <tp:type>Message_Header_Key</tp:type> and
          <tp:type>Message_Body_Key</tp:type> types, respectively.  It is an
          error for a connection manager to put keys referring to the message
          as a whole in the second or subsequent Message_Part, or keys intended
          for body parts in the first Message_Part; clients MUST recover from
          this error by ignoring these mis-placed keys.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Instead of representing messages as aa{sv} where the first
            dictionary is special (a dictionary of headers), we could have
            used a signature like (a{sv}aa{sv}) to separate out the headers
            and the body parts.</p>

          <p>However, this would make access to the messages more awkward.
            In Python, the syntax for access to a header field would remain
            <code>message[0]['message-type']</code>, but access to a body
            field in the second body part would change from
            <code>message[2]['content'] to message[1][1]['content']</code>. In
            GLib, the message would change from being a
            <code>GPtrArray(GHashTable)</code> to being a
            <code>GValueArray(GHashTable, GPtrArray(GHashTable))</code> which
            is rather inconvenient to dereference.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>In any group of parts with the same non-empty value for the
          <tt>alternative</tt> key (which represent alternative versions of the
          same content), more faithful versions of the intended message MUST
          come before less faithful versions (note that this order is the
          opposite of MIME <tt>multipart/alternative</tt> parts). Clients
          SHOULD display the first alternative that they understand.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Specifying the preference order means that if the underlying
            protocol doesn't support alternatives, the CM can safely delete
            everything apart from the first supported alternative when
            sending messages.</p>

          <p>The order is the reverse of MIME because MIME's rationale for
            placing the "plainest" part first (legibility in pre-MIME UAs)
            does not apply to us, and placing the most preferred part
            first simplifies display (a client can iterate the message
            in order, display the first alternative that it understands,
            and skip displaying all subsequent parts with the same
            "alternative" key).</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>Clients SHOULD present all parts that are not redundant
          alternatives in the order they appear in this array, possibly
          excluding parts that are referenced by another displayed part.
          It is implementation-specific how the parts are presented to the
          user.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>This allows CMs to assume that all parts are actually shown to
            the user, even if they are not explicitly referenced - we do
            not yet recommend formatted text, and there is no way for
            plain text to reference an attachment since it has no concept of
            markup or references. This also forces clients to do something
            sensible with messages that consist entirely of "attachments",
            with no "body" at all.</p>

          <p>For instance, when displaying the above example, a client that
            understands the HTML part should display the JPEG image once,
            between the two lines "Here is a photo of my cat:" and
            "Isn't it cute?"; it may additionally present the image in some
            way for a second time, after "Isn't it cute?", or may choose
            not to.</p>

          <p>A client that does not understand HTML, displaying the same
            message, should display the plain-text part, followed by the JPEG
            image.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <h3>Delivery reports</h3>

        <div>
          <p>Delivery reports are also represented as messages with the
            <tt>message-type</tt> header mapping to
            <tp:type>Channel_Text_Message_Type</tp:type> Delivery_Report.
            Delivery reports SHOULD contain the <tt>message-sender</tt> header,
            mapping to the intended recipient of the original message, if
            possible; other headers specific to delivery reports are defined by
            the <tp:type>Delivery_Report_Header_Key</tp:type> type. The second
            and subsequent parts, if present, are a human-readable report from
            the IM service.</p>

          <p>For backwards- and forwards-compatibility, whenever a delivery
            error report is signalled—that is, with <tt>delivery-status</tt>
            mapping to <tp:type>Delivery_Status</tp:type> Temporarily_Failed or

              namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Text">SendError</tp:dbus-ref>
            is emitted, a delivery report MUST also be signalled.
            Delivery report messages on this interface MUST be represented in
            emissions of <tp:dbus-ref
              namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Text">Received</tp:dbus-ref>
            as messages with the Non_Text_Content
            <tp:type>Channel_Text_Message_Flags</tp:type>; clients which

                aggressive about including (possibly truncated) message

          signalled on its own if the message is deleted without being read, or
          after <code>Read</code> if the message was read before being deleted.

      <tp:docstring>
        Flags indicating the level of support for delivery reporting on this
        channel, as found on the
        <tp:member-ref>DeliveryReportingSupport</tp:member-ref> property. Any
        future flags added to this set will conform to the
        convention that the presence of an extra flag implies that
        more operations will succeed. Note that CMs may always provide more
        reports than are requested in the
        <tp:type>Message_Sending_Flags</tp:type> passed to
        <tp:member-ref>SendMessage</tp:member-ref>.

        <tp:rationale>
          If senders want delivery reports, they should ask for them.  If they
          don't want delivery reports, they can just ignore them, so there's no
          need to have capability discovery for what will happen if a delivery
          report isn't requested.

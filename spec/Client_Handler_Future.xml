      <p>This interface contains functionality which we intend to incorporate
        into the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Handler</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface in future. It should be considered to
        be conceptually part of the core Handler interface, but without
        API or ABI guarantees.</p>

        <p>If true, channels destined for this handler that have the
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Interface"
            >Conference.DRAFT</tp:dbus-ref> interface, with a channel that
          was previously handled by the same client process in their
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Interface.Conference.DRAFT"
            >InitialChannels</tp:dbus-ref> property, should bypass the
          approval stage. In effect, this is a weaker form of
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Handler"
            >BypassApproval</tp:dbus-ref>.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>It would be reasonable for a user interface to accept
            invitations to continuations of an existing channel automatically,
            or not; this is a matter of UI policy.</p>

          <p>It's somewhat complex for an Approver to keep track of which
            channels are being handled by a particular Handler, but
            the Channel Dispatcher already has to track this, so it's
            useful for the channel dispatcher to assist here.</p>
